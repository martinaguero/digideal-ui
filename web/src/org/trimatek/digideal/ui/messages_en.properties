main_subtitle= A digital deal to simplify and speed up the exchange of products and services. DigiDeal is a standalone service for Bitcoin technology, at Internet scale and designed to contemporize agreements between people. Once a new deal is created, DigiBot guides and coordinates the whole process via email.
main_what_synthesis=It is a payment system where the funds are sent to a neutral address within the Blockchain. There, they stay in custody until the agreement is fulfilled from both parties. Then, DigiBot validates the operation and releases the funds, once it receives the receipt code.
main_for_synthesis=The agreement form allows any kind of commitment to be established between the parties. Once the buyer sends the funds, DigiBot notifies the seller that the product or service can be delivered. The funds are released only when the agreement is fulfilled.
main_how_synthesis=DigiDeal automatically manages the funds that are sent to a P2SH Bitcoin address. The payment transaction is immediately sent to the Blockchain once the fulfillment of the agreement is confirmed. The cost of the service matches the fee of the transaction.
page_result_title = Request sent!
page_result_text = The agreement text has been sent and it is in validation process. In a few minutes, DigiBot will communicate how the process continues via email to all parties. Once approved, a follow up can be done from <a style="color: #1da1f2;" href="./status.xhtml">track</a> option in menu.

p2sh_subtitle=(Pay to Script Hash)
smartc_subtitle=
oracle_subtitle=
api_subtitle=(Application Programming Interface)
p2sh_text_1=It is a technology developed by the Bitcoin community (BIP-16) where the funds are sent to a special address (P2SH multisig address) and they can only be released with a redeem script and an authorized signature.
p2sh_text_2=The send funds to a P2SH address transaction is stored in the Blockchain and must be confirmed by the miners, same as all other Bitcoin transactions. Funds are safely secured and availability is guaranteed by the decentralized consensus of the network. Only with the private key and the redeem script, those funds can be sent to another address.
p2sh_text_3=As the figure shows, for a P2SH transaction to be spent (TX1), a third party (Bob) must provide the signature from his private key and the complete redeem script. The peer-to-peer network of Bitcoin verifies that the hash provided by Bob is the same associated with the output of TX1.
smartc_text_1=A smart contract is a self-enforcing agreement embedded in computer code managed by a blockchain. The code contains a set of rules under which the parties of that smart contract agree to interact with each other. If and when the prede ned rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. Smart contracts provide mechanisms for e ciently managing tokenized assets and access rights between two or more parties. One can think of it like a cryptographic box that unlocks value or access, if and when specific predefined conditions are met. 
smartc_text_2=Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.
smartc_text_3=<br/><b>Key Takeaways:</b> <br/>&nbsp;&#8226; Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. <br/>&nbsp;&#8226; Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist who invented a virtual currency called "Bit Gold" in 1998, defined smart contracts as computerized transaction protocols that execute terms of a contract. <br/>&nbsp;&#8226; Smart contracts render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.<br/><br/>The service offered by DigiDeal, can be considered as an implementation of the concept.
robot_text_0=The robot validates the agreement, interacts with the Blockchain creating and searching for transactions, it also authorizes the fund release if it receives the information to certify that the agreement is fulfilled. See next a representation of the process:  
robot_text_1=1\uFE0F\u20E3 The buyer or seller creates a new agreement from the <a target="_blank" style="color: #1da1f2;" href="./form.xhtml">form</a>
robot_text_2=2\uFE0F\u20E3 DigiBot validates the agreement and sends emails with the instructions
robot_text_3=3\uFE0F\u20E3 The buyer sends the funds to the address appointed in the instructions
robot_text_4=4\uFE0F\u20E3 Once the transaction is validated, DigiBot confirms via email to the seller that the product or service can be delivered. It also sends an email to the buyer with the receipt code
robot_text_5=5\uFE0F\u20E3 The buyer receives the product and shows the receipt code to the seller
robot_text_6=6\uFE0F\u20E3 The seller scans the QR with the code and sends it via email to DigiBot
robot_text_7=7\uFE0F\u20E3 DigiBot validates the code and unlocks the funds, that are sent to the seller
robot_text_10=During the whole process, both parties receive emails with instructions and information about the status of the agreement. They can also inquire the status of every agreement from the <a target="_blank" style="color: #1da1f2;" href="./status.xhtml">track</a> option.

robot_right_arrow=\uD83D\uDC49
robot_finish=\uD83C\uDFC1
robot_subtitle = How to use it?
robot_fee = How much does it cost?
robot_fee_detail = In step 7, DigiBot validates the receipt code and unlocks the funds. In this transaction, it charges its services by subtracting from the amount in custody, a value equal to the commission charged by a miner to process that transaction of 1 entry and 2 exits (approximately US$ 0.62).
cases_subtitle= Some examples
cases_c1_title= Painting works
cases_c1_text1= @Alice needs some painting works in her house and @Bob, the painter, doesn't want to have difficulties to get paid. So a DigiDeal is created, Alice sends funds and Bob starts the job without hesitation. Once the work is done, Alice shows the receipt code to Bob and everybody is happy!
cases_c2_title= Bicycle
cases_c2_text1= @Kevin found in an Internet catalog a bicycle published by @Peter and he loves it! Considering that Kevin's house is several blocks away, they decide to create a DigiDeal. So when Kevin sends funds, Peter takes the bike to Kevin's house, who shows the receipt code upon reception. Now let's ride!
cases_c3_title= Youtuber
cases_c3_text1= @Patrick is an increasingly famous youtuber and he needs his videos to be more and more professional, this is why he contacted @Kirsten who is an expert video editor. They both decide to create a DigiDeal, so Kirsten starts her work knowing that "money is there". Once she sends the final version, Patrick shares the code and the work is paid!
cases_c4_title= Rent
cases_c4_text1= @Katy's family is planning their next holiday trip and found that the house that @Julia is offering fits perfectly to their needs. They decide to create a DigiDeal, so Katy's family guarantees ability to pay and Julia receives payment for the rent, as soon as the receipt code is received and without intermediaries!
cases_c5_title= Pizza
cases_c5_text1= @Brian and his friends will get together at his house and they want pizza from @Vitto's, who only delivers with DigiDeal because he doesn't want the delivery guys to handle money. Then the pizza arrives, Brian checks that it's the double cheese pepperoni that they are expecting, shows the receipt code to the delivery guy and let's enjoy it! 
cases_footer = These are just some examples of DigiDeal use. Since the <a target="_blank" style="color: #1da1f2;" href="./form.xhtml">form</a> does not establish restrictions, it is adaptable to any everyday situation, such as ordering a pizza or something eventual like a temporary rental. In a normal process, there is no human intervention, DigiBot coordinates and acts according to the agreement terms and the actions of the participants.
faq_g1_title = Cost
faq_g1_title1 = What is the charge paid by the buyer?
faq_g1_text1 = The buyer should only be responsible for the cost of the transaction to send the funds.
faq_g1_title2 = What extra charge should the seller pay?
faq_g1_text2 = When unlocking the funds in custody, the cost of the transaction is paid to the miner and the same amount is paid, as commission for DigiDeal (approximately US$ 1.55 in total).
faq_g1_title3 = Is the DigiDeal charge fixed?
faq_g1_text3 = Always, even if the agreement is for US$ 10 or US $10.000, the DigiDeal commission will always be the same. The same fee a miner charges to process the payment transaction (step 7 of the <a target="_blank" style="color: #1da1f2;" href="./robot.xhtml"> process </ a >).
faq_g2_title = Technology
faq_g2_title1 = Why is DigiDeal innovative?
faq_g2_text1 = Because during the normal process of agreement, there is no human intervention. The actions of the participants are evaluated by algorithms that decide if the environment is adjusted to what is defined in the agreement.
faq_g2_title2 = What is the advantage of adjusting an agreement between people to the decisions of a robot?
faq_g2_text2 =  Mainly because in no case the process can be influenced by subjective actions or damaged by errors or omissions of human beings.
faq_g2_title3 =  DigiDeal works only with Bitcoin?
faq_g2_text3 =  Currently yes, but it is planned to expand its use to other cryptocurrencies that prove to be as secure as Bitcoin.
faq_g3_title = Disputes
faq_g3_title1 = If the delivered by the seller does not meet my expectations, can I recover the funds?
faq_g3_text1 = If the buyer did not show the receipt code, the funds can be returned.
faq_g3_title2 =  If the buyer sends an amount lower than agreed, the seller will receive less?
faq_g3_text2 = No, the robot verifies that the transaction of sending funds equals the amount agreed, if the number is lower, it will request to send the difference as many times as necessary.
page_oracle = Oracle
oracle_text_0 = An oracle is an agent outside the Blockchain that allows to verify arbitrary conditions. The oracles provide the required data in order to let smart contracts be executed, when the original terms of the contract are fulfilled. This conditions can be any event linked to the contract, for example: temperature, payment execution, price change, exchange listing and others. The oracles are the link between intelligent contracts and the outside world.
oracle_text_1 = In ancient times, an oracle was a person, often priest or priestess, who offered advice or prophecy to people seeking guidance. The oracles were considered as sacred beings that were connected to the gods.
oracle_text_2 = Mainly, an oracle must deliver the truth to a block chain, so that intelligent contracts can be executed correctly. 
oracle_text_3 = DigiDeal is also an oracle that validates the availability of funds and the receipt code to unlock the payment transaction.

Under normal conditions, there is never human intervention, the whole process is guided by algorithms according to the definitions of the agreement between the parties. The transferred funds are the property of the buyer until the seller sends the receipt code. In case the seller could not demonstrate compliance with the agreement, the funds would be returned to the buyer. The agent will always charge, as a commission, the same amount as the miner's commission that confirms the payment transaction.
